I always disliked how BHS worked. Where medkits give temporary hp and most random items heal certain parts.

This mod is my attempt at making BHS fun and immersive instead of just "use a if b, use c if d".

Currently in active development to balance the items and the system.

**MOD IS VERY WIP SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND ON SERIOUSLY USING IT.**

**An overview of the mod and plans below.**
# General points:
## The goals of the mod:
  - Make healing limbs take considerably longer.
  - Remove temporary HP.
  - Add painkillers and painkilling properties. Think of tarkov.
  - Make medkits the main source of healing, like they should be.
  - Make the system highly configurable.

## **Stuff that this mod already has:**
  - No temp hp System. Replaced by painkillers instead. Exactly the same purpose as tarkov basically. Allow you to use the destroyed limbs and remove the nasty effects.
  - To complement painkiller system weapon sway mod is integrated. Painkillers reduce weapon sway like if the limb is healed by that amount.
  - Medkits either heal all parts at once OR they heal set amount of HP, going one HP at a time for the lowest HP limb(potentially more efficient, which makes a lot of sense).
  - Broken limb system. If HP of the limb reaches 0 you need to splint it via survival kit(default),tourniquet,bandage or medkit(all configurable and can turn off).
  - Reworked sleep healing to heal more logically(you heal lowest limbs first). Can disable that.
  - Health multiplier to enable more gradual healing. Limb HP by default is 11 torso, head; 5 for the rest - kinda low. - Experimental. Realistically would do nothing but increase the number of HP steps so it looks smoother but makes it hard to see real HP

## **Stuff i will add:**
  - All the items and balancing.
  - Reduce medkit heal rate to be slower. Increase the usefulness of stimpaks.
  - Campfire heal for limbs(adapting script)
  - Artefact healing for limbs(same thing)
  - More effects on limb damage. Instead of instadeath increase received damage, stuff like that - need ideas
  - BHS screen in inventory(also adapt) - might need help to do that. Hopefully not as i like dynahud
  - EFT meds, if possible via DLTX
  - Heal limbs one-by-one only like in EFT(maybe)

  Keep in mind that in the more-or-less finished version **everything will be optional modules**. While in development i wont split it into modules so my workload is more sane.
