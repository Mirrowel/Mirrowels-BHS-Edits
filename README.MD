# General points:
- **Shit i already have:**
  - No instaheal items for BHS
  - No temp hp System. Replaced by painkillers instead. Exactly the same purpose as tarkov basically. Allow you to use the destroyed limbs and remove the nasty effects.
  - Medkits heal slow instead of instant in BHS.
  - Medkits either heal all parts at once OR they heal set amount of HP, going one HP at a time for the lowest HP limb(potentially more efficient, which makes a lot of sense).
  - Broken limb system. If HP of the limb reaches 0 you need to splint it via survival kit(default), tourniquet,bandage or medkit(all configurable and can turn off).
  - Reworked sleep healing to heal more logically(you heal lowest limbs first). Can disable that.
  - ~~Health multiplier to enable more gradual healing. Limb HP by default is 11 torso, head; 5 for the rest - kinda low~~.

- **Shit i will add:**

  - Campfire heal for limbs(adapting script)
  - Artefact healing for limbs(same thing)
  - BHS screen in inventory(also adapt)
