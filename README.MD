I always disliked how BHS worked. Where medkits give temporary hp and most random items heal certain parts.

This mod is my attempt at making BHS fun and immersive instead of just "use a if b, use c if d".

Currently in active development to balance the items and the system.

MORE UP-TO-DATE Description on Moddb page https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/bhs-realistic-overhaul

All new items are sold by medics. Some new items also added to flea market and butcher's shop.
As well as a lot of different traders that don't have medics nearby.

**MOD IS CONSTANTLY BEING DEVELOPED SO EXPECT CHANGES TO HAPPEN FREQUENTLY.**

**An overview of the mod and plans below.**
# General points:
## The goals of the mod:
  - Make healing limbs take considerably longer.
  - Remove temporary HP.
  - Add painkillers and painkilling properties. Think of tarkov.
  - Make medkits the main source of healing, like they should be.
  - Make the system highly configurable.

## **Stuff that this mod already has:**
  - No temp hp System. Replaced by painkillers instead. Exactly the same purpose as tarkov basically. Allow you to use the destroyed limbs and remove the nasty effects.
  - To complement painkiller system weapon sway mod is integrated. Painkillers reduce weapon sway like if the limb is healed by that amount.
  - Medkits either heal all parts at once OR they heal set amount of HP, going one HP at a time for the lowest HP limb(potentially more efficient, which makes a lot of sense).
  - Broken limb system. If HP of the limb reaches 0 you need to use a surgical kit, then splint with a splint(all configurable and can turn off).
  - Reworked sleep healing to heal more logically(you heal lowest limbs first). Can disable that.
  - Health multiplier to enable more gradual healing. Limb HP by default is 11 torso, head; 5 for the rest - kinda low. - Experimental. Realistically would do nothing but increase the number of HP steps so it looks smoother but makes it hard to see real HP
  - Weapon sway depending on arms damage and painkiller effect
  - Slower medkit usage and healing rate.
  - Campfire heal for limbs(adapting script)
  - Artefact healing for limbs(same thing)

## **Stuff i will add:**
  - More effects on limb damage. Instead of instadeath increase received damage, stuff like that - need ideas
  - Heal limbs one-by-one only like in EFT(maybe)

  Keep in mind that in the more-or-less finished version **everything will be optional modules**. While in development i wont split it into modules so my workload is more sane.


# Balancing for meds:
- All medkits heal twice as slow. Overall they heal exactly the same amount, just slower. New time is 66.8 seconds.
- Survival kit modified using same logic as medkits, but with radiation and healing boosted to match heal speed of basic medkit. New time is 90 seconds.
- Rebirth modded to last twice as long. Same idea as medkits. New time is 14 seconds.
- Bandages apply their effect instantly instead of over time.
## As for limb damage:
Keep in mind these values: Legs and Arms have 10HP per limb. Torso and Head have 22HP per limb. 
That is double of what basic BHS has to make 1HP matter less in the system making balancing easier.
No, boosting HP does not make limbs survive more damage. Everything is scaled.

---
- ### Heal One System(Healing one HP at a time for one limb):
  - Basic medkit: 21 HP total over the duration. Can heal two arms/legs to full or torso/head once
  - Army and Cheese: 42 HP total over the duration. Can heal all arms/legs to full or both torso and head to full.
  - Stimpacks: Mirror what medkits heal over their duration, but faster.
  - Survival kit: 63 HP total over 90 seconds.
  - Coagulant(Vinca/Barvinok): Heals 11 HP over 438 seconds. Cant heal over your HP level. (If you are at 50% then it can only heal limbs to 50%)
  - Rebirth: 63 HP total over 17 seconds. Cant heal over your HP level. (If you are at 50% then it can only heal limbs to 50%)
  - Propital: 30 HP total over 180 seconds. Cant heal over your HP level.
---
- ### Heal All System(Healing one HP at a time for all limbs):
  - Basic medkit: Head/Torso - 11 HP, Legs/Arms - 5 HP total over the duration. Can heal two arms/legs to full or torso/head once
  - Army and Cheese: Head/Torso - 16 HP, Legs/Arms - 7 HP total over the duration. Can heal all arms/legs to full or both torso and head to full.
  - Stimpacks: Mirror what medkits heal over their duration, but faster.
  - Rebirth: Head/Torso - 22 HP, Legs/Arms - 10 HP over 17 seconds. Cant heal over your HP level. (If you are at 50% then it can only heal limbs to 50%)

- ### Surgery system and kits:
In order to restore a limb to 1 HP surgical tools are required.
- Surgical tools: Slow use, restores one limb to be splinted in 10 seconds. One use and needs a bandage. Will cause damage on use.
- CMS: Slow use, 5 charges. Restores one limb to be splinted in 10 seconds. Can be configured to restore a limb without a splint required. More weight-efficient

- ### Splints:
- Splint: Slow use, restores a limb to full 1HP in 10 seconds. Once charge.
- Aluminium splints: Slow use, restores a limb to full 1HP in 10 seconds. Three charges. More weight-efficient

# Latest changelog:
## 0.63 Beta:
- Dynamic item spawns,item rewards,new game loadouts DLTX item injection
- Safe deletion utility to safely delete all new items
- Loot injection for new items. Now they can be looted from bodies.
## Hotfix 0.6A:
- Fixed mutant harvest animation
- Added FDDA MCM unlocker for gamma users
## 0.6 Beta:
### Additions and rebalancing:
- Bandages and tourniquets now work instantly instead of over time.
- Vodka's are now painkillers of different power.
- To be able to sprint with broken legs you now need painkiller power 3 and above. Vodkas provide up to 2.
- Psy mechanics for SJ stims. Now they lower your max psy health but increase resistance and regeneration the lower your psy health is. (EXPERIMENTAL)
- A lot more traders sell new items now, and old ones should be fixed, hopefully.
- Compatibility patch for Coffee if the zone to use better anims.
- Damage to limbs increased by 25%. Hopefully losing limbs will be more frequent.
### Fixes:
- Painkillers active time is now tracked a lot better, so level transitions wont extend their duration. Nor saving/loading will extend/decrease it. Deviation will be very small % wise.
- Detailed description compatibility now has fixed encoding for dot symbols
- Default detailed description script fixes(included by default, not compat)
- Artefact healing now wont work if you dont have PBA mod installed. Meaning if you want to use it in base anomaly you need to patch it. I would do that if i had vanilla classnames and values for them - it is not hard at all.
- General bugfixing for main script
- DLTX bugfixing to make sure included mods are not overwritten by standalone versions of same mods.
- Animation files bugfixing to change as little as possible compared to base FDDA + asnen's. Now should be 100% compatible as no old anims are overwritten or deleted.
- Damage threshold lowered back to 3% like default. Now consumable items are tracked and wont deal damage to limbs
- Renamed Enchaned UI compat to "Enhanced GUI". Got confused about names
