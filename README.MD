# General points:
Shit i already have:
-No instaheal items for BHS
-No temp hp System. Replaced by painkillers instead. Exactly the same purpose as tarkov basically. Allow you to use the destroyed limbs and remove the nasty effects
-Medkits heal slow instead of instant in BHS
-Medkits either heal all parts at once OR they heal set amount of HP, going one HP at a time for the lowest HP limb(potentially more efficient, which makes a lot of sense)
-Broken limb system. If HP of the limb reaches 0 you need to splint it via survival kit(default), tourniquet,bandage or medkit(all configurable and can turn off)
Reworked sleep healing to heal more logically(you heal lowest limbs first). Can disable that
Health multiplier to enable more gradual healing. Limb HP by default is 11 torso, head; 5 for the rest - kinda low
Shit i will add:
Campfire heal for limbs(adapting script)
Artefact healing for limbs(same thing)
BHS screen in inventory(also adapt)
